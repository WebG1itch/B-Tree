The program itself is pretty simple to run. Simply type 'make' in tesla and it will ask you to define n
to define n, type a number and press enter. If your number is less than 400, it will automatically make n 400.

The program will print out the order in which it inserted the numbers.
Then it will print out the numbers in numerical order by traversing the tree.
Finally it will print all numbers from n to 2n in numerical order by traversing the tree

When the program has finished running, you can enter 'make clean' to remove any residual files, like '*.o' files.
